Unreal Project Renamer

Unreal Project Renamer is a user-friendly Python tool with a graphical user interface (GUI), designed specifically for Unreal Engine projects. It allows developers to seamlessly rename their project and update all associated files, folders, and API references.
Features

    Project Renaming: Updates the project name across all relevant files (.uproject, .cpp, .h, .ini, .cs, .uplugin).
    API Adjustment: Automatically updates API references (e.g., OLD_API → NEW_API).
    Easy Browsing: Select your project directory conveniently using the integrated GUI.
    User-Friendly: Simple interface with no coding skills required.
    Error Handling: Displays helpful error messages and success notifications.

Why use this tool?

Renaming an Unreal Engine project manually can be tedious and error-prone, as it requires updating multiple files and API references. This tool automates the entire process, ensuring consistency and saving valuable time.
